        <blockquote cite="https://www.betterup.com/blog/working-smarter-not-harder">
            Carving out time in your day to dedicate to work keeps you organized and limits distractions. Be mindful of how you schedule your day and any possible distractions that could come your way.

            Are you a morning worker, but a daily meeting interrupts your flow? Do your coworkers come to you with questions while you're in the middle of something? Use one of the many tools for managing your calendar, scheduling focus time, and blocking notifications. Then, honor your calendar.
